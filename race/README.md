# Getting Started with Hyper

Hyper is a web application designed for Formula 1 fans and enthusiasts, as well as those new to the sport. The project aims to provide an interactive platform where users can engage with various features tailored to their interests.

## Features

### Pick Your Podium
In the "Pick Your Podium" feature, users are tasked with selecting three drivers whom they believe will stand on the podium after each race. This interactive component adds an element of prediction and excitement to the racing experience.

### Pick Your Point
The "Pick Your Point" feature challenges users to predict which driver will secure the last point on the grid. In Formula 1, only the top ten finishers receive points, making the battle for the final point position highly competitive. This feature focuses on the midfield battle and adds an additional layer of engagement for users.

## Project Development
Hyper is currently under development. The project is being built with careful attention to detail and user experience, ensuring that it meets the needs and expectations of Formula 1 fans and non-fans alike.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, ready for deployment. The build is minified and optimized for better performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies directly into your project.
